Why aren't the tests running?
-----------------------------
This may be an internet connectivity issue. To run the tests, a large amount of data (~2 GB) is downloaded from the Dropbox account that is associated with this package. This data is not included with the package for user convenience. If internet connectivity issues are not easily addressed, please contact asavel@berkeley.edu for alternatives.
